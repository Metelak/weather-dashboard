# **Challenge 6: Weather Dashboard**

Developing a weather app to draw data from OpenWeather API to provide current weather information when a city is searched. 

## **User Story**
AS A traveler
* I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities 
* SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## **Acceptance Criteria:**
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
* WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
* WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
* WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
